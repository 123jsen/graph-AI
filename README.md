# graph-AI
Using keras, implement a graph AI that can do tasks on graph. E.g. solve some algorithms.

# How to use
Try `Graph_Generation.ipynb` to know the logic of the graph generation system. To generate the required JSON files, use `generate_graph_to_json.py`. Try `-h` for more arguments. Please note that you need a `data` folder to put the output if you are using the default path.

# Tasks
1. Count the number of nodes on the graph
2. Check whether there is a cycle in the graph.
3. Output the MST of the weighted graph
